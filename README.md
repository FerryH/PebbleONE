The ONE Pebble Watch Face
=========================

This is a highly readable analog watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch][pebble], intended for every-day use.
Its features are customizable, but I want to keep the overall look simple.

You need the [Pebble SDK 2.0][sdk2] to build it.

Contributions are highly welcome - just send me a [pull request][pullreq].
